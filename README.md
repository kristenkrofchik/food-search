# Meal Maker Recipe Finder

Meal Maker is a recipe finder app built with Node.js on the backend, and React on the frontend. It is styled with Grommet. The app utilizes food data from the spoonacular API. 

### User Flow

A user will enter the site via the Homepage. From there, they enter an ingredient in the search box. When the user sends their ingredient, the frontend sends a request to the backend which sends a request to the spoonacular API. The spoonacular API returns a list of recipes utilizing the user's chosen ingredient. The list of recipes is then displayed on the Results page.
